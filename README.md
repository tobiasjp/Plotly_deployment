## Overview

If you're anything of a proclaimed germophobe, like I am, then you likely spend your time AVOIDING thoughts of just how many germs are really out there.  What about the amount of germs on you now?  Our perpetual microscope 'friends' are everywhere, whether we like it or not.  As much as one probably washes their hands or bodies, we can never guarantee that they are all completely gone.
